# Rules of Set:
A Set deck conists of 81 unique cards that vary in four respects
	Number of shapes: 1-3
	Shape type: Diamond, Tilte, Oval
	Opacity: Transparent, Translucent, Opaque
	Color: Green, Blue, Red
Each possible combination of features appears only once in a deck
To make a "set" of cards, you must meet one of two criteria for all for features
I.e. for each feature, one of the following must apply:
	All 3 cards are the same with respect to this feature
	All 3 cards are unique with respect to this feature
For example, all 3 cards can have unique shapes and opacities, and also have the same number and color, and this would be a valid set

#Playing the game
At the beginning of the game, each player takes 12 cards from their deck and begins trying to create sets, anytime a set is made, or it is impossible to make more sets, the player lays out 3 more cards
The objective of the game is to make sets out of the entire deck, in other words you are finished if you have every card in one of your sets, and you win the game if you are the first to do so in your group
